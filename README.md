# ‚òÑÔ∏è as the body falls üåÄ

Welcome to the repository for **as the body falls**, a node applicaton for your terminal that generates images based on falling planets. It supports custom palettes, planets, and parameters, and there's endless possibilities and permutations!

So how does this all work? Basically, you get to choose the number and position of "gravity points" on your image that have mass. Then for each pixel, it drops a little planet that falls toward the points. The point that it falls into determines the color of the pixel!
